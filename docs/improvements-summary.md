# AI Escape Room - Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the AI Escape Room project based on the requirements for better API design, Firebase integration, and competitive features.

## 1. API Endpoint Improvements ✅

### Restructured Game Commands
The API endpoints have been restructured to match the command pattern specified in the SYSTEM_PROMPT:

- **GET `/api/game/look`** - Look around the room and see all objects
- **GET `/api/game/inspect?object=object_name`** - Inspect a specific object for details
- **POST `/api/game/guess?object=object_name&answer=puzzle`** - Submit puzzle answers for objects
- **POST `/api/game/password?password=password`** - Submit the final password to escape
- **GET `/api/game/hint`** - Get hints for the current room
- **POST `/api/game/restart`** - Restart the current game

### Benefits:
- Clear RESTful API design with appropriate HTTP methods
- Query parameters for object-specific actions
- Consistent response formats
- Better error handling and status codes

## 2. Timer Functionality ✅

### Implementation:
- Timer starts automatically when a new game is created
- Time elapsed is calculated when the game is completed
- Timer data is included in the game session

### Features:
- Tracks game start time in `UserGameSession`
- Calculates total time elapsed on game completion
- Returns time in seconds in the `/password` endpoint response

## 3. Firebase Integration ✅

### User Storage:
- Users are automatically saved to Firebase Firestore on registration
- Email uniqueness validation through Firebase
- API keys are hashed before storage for security

### Configuration:
- Environment variable based configuration
- Support for Firebase service account credentials
- Graceful fallback if Firebase is not configured

### Data Structure:
```javascript
// Users Collection
{
  id: "uuid",
  name: "string",
  email: "string",
  hashedApiKeys: { /* encrypted */ },
  registeredAt: "timestamp",
  updatedAt: "timestamp"
}
```

## 4. Leaderboard System ✅

### Endpoints:
- **GET `/api/game/leaderboard`** - Get global leaderboard
- **GET `/api/game/leaderboard/me`** - Get user's best scores
- **POST `/api/game/leaderboard/submit`** - Submit a score

### Features:
- Tracks completion time and hints used
- Filters by game mode
- Automatic ranking
- User's personal best scores

### Data Structure:
```javascript
// Leaderboard Collection
{
  userId: "uuid",
  userName: "string",
  gameId: "string",
  gameMode: "single-custom | multi-custom",
  timeElapsed: 300, // seconds
  hintsUsed: 2,
  submittedAt: "timestamp"
}
```

## 5. Hint Tracking ✅

- Hints used are tracked per game session
- Count is included in leaderboard submissions
- Affects competitive scoring

## 6. CLI Improvements ✅

### Updated Command Handling:
- Direct API calls for each command instead of generic command endpoint
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Support for new endpoints

### Command Examples:
```bash
/newgame              # Start a new game
/look                 # See all objects in the room
/inspect clock        # Inspect the clock object
/guess clock 1234     # Guess puzzle answer for clock
/password escape123   # Try final password
/hint                 # Get a hint
/restart             # Restart current game
```

## 7. Documentation ✅

### Created Documentation:
1. **API Documentation** (`docs/api-documentation.md`)
   - Complete endpoint reference
   - Request/response examples
   - Authentication details

2. **Firebase Setup Guide** (`docs/firebase-setup.md`)
   - Step-by-step Firebase configuration
   - Security rules
   - Environment variable setup

## 8. Security Improvements ✅

- API keys are hashed before storing in Firebase
- JWT authentication for all game endpoints
- Proper error handling to avoid information leakage
- Firebase security rules for data protection

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### 1. Implement Individual Object Puzzle Tracking
Currently, the `/guess` endpoint for individual objects is a placeholder. Consider:
- Extending RoomAgent to track puzzle solutions per object
- Implementing a puzzle unlock system
- Progressive password revelation

### 2. Real-time Features
- WebSocket support for live leaderboard updates
- Multiplayer race mode
- Real-time hints from other players

### 3. Enhanced Game Mechanics
- Difficulty levels affecting timer and hints
- Achievement system
- Daily challenges

### 4. Analytics
- Track puzzle solving patterns
- Average completion times per puzzle
- Popular hint requests

### 5. Production Deployment
- Set up Firebase production environment
- Configure proper CORS settings
- Implement rate limiting
- Add monitoring and logging

## Installation Requirements

To use the new features, install the additional dependency:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with:
```env
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-client-email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="your-private-key"
FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your-project.firebaseio.com
```
